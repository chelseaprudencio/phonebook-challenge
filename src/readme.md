Design Decisions & Trade-offs

Theme Choice: I chose the Yellow Pages theme because it plays with the phonebook project gist and looks cool to me. 
Accessibility Focus: I prioritized accessibility with ARIA live regions for search results, form labeling with aria-describedby for hints, and semantic HTML structure. 
Component Structure: I kept everything in a single App.jsx for
Section 1. Im sure as the other sections starts to get built ill have to grow my section count.
CSS Approach: I used claude for CSS custom properties cause i thought the yellow book idea was pretty niche. I promptef it to include a responsive grid to auto-fill and adapt  to screen sizes.
